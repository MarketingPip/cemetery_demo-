When you start mapping out your family tree, you can quickly find yourself tangled in a web of cousins, second cousins, once removed, and all kinds of other titles. One relationship that often trips people up is: **What do you call your cousin’s kid?** 

You might instinctively think that your cousin’s son is your second cousin, but that’s not quite right. In this post, we’ll break down why your cousin’s son isn’t your second cousin — and explain what he actually is to you.

### What Are First Cousins?

Let’s start with the basics: First cousins.

First cousins are people who share the same **grandparents**. In other words, your parents are siblings, and you and your cousin are both the next generation down from those grandparents. This makes you **first cousins** because you share a direct family connection through your **grandparents**.

For example, let’s say your father and your cousin’s mother are siblings. You and your cousin both share your grandparents (your father’s parents), which is what makes you first cousins.

### So, What About Second Cousins?

Now, we move on to **second cousins**.

Second cousins are a step further down the family tree. They share the same **great-grandparents**, but they are from a different line. Your second cousins are the children of your parents’ first cousins. This means that while you and your second cousin share a set of **great-grandparents**, your direct family lines are from different generations.

Here’s an easy way to think about it:
- Your **grandparents** are your first cousins’ grandparents.
- Your **great-grandparents** are your second cousins’ great-grandparents.

So, second cousins are from the same generation, and their **great-grandparents** are the shared common ancestor.

### The Case of Your Cousin’s Son

So where does your **cousin’s son** fit in all of this?

Let’s break it down. Your cousin is your **first cousin**, meaning you share the same **grandparents**. Your cousin’s son, however, is **one generation below** you and your cousin. That’s a key point.

Your cousin’s son still shares a **great-grandparent** with you — but because he’s from a different generation (he’s your cousin’s child), he’s considered **one generation removed** from you. 

That makes him your **first cousin once removed**. Here’s the breakdown:

- Your **grandparents** are his **great-grandparents**.
- He is one generation younger than you, which is why he’s **removed**.
  
This relationship is often confusing because people assume that “once removed” means something like "second cousin," but it actually refers to the **generation gap**.

### Why He’s Not Your Second Cousin

To be a second cousin, you need to be from the **same generation**. This means you both have to share the same level of great-grandparents, and you need to be in the same generational line. Since your cousin’s son is a generation younger than you, he can’t be your second cousin.

So, no — your cousin’s son is not your second cousin. He’s **your first cousin once removed** because he is from a different generation, but still shares a direct ancestor with you (your great-grandparents).

### In Conclusion

When it comes to family, the terminology can get a little tricky. But understanding the generational structure of your family tree helps clear up a lot of confusion. 

To summarize:

- **First cousins**: Share grandparents, same generation.
- **Second cousins**: Share great-grandparents, same generation.
- **First cousin once removed**: One generation apart, share great-grandparents.

Your cousin’s son is **one generation removed** from you, so he’s your **first cousin once removed**, not your second cousin. Family trees can get complicated, but once you understand the basic structure, it becomes a lot easier to figure out who’s who in your family!

Hopefully, this article helps clear up any confusion next time you're trying to explain who’s who in your family.
