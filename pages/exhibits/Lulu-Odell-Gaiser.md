**Lulu Odell Gaiser: A Life of Trailblazing Achievements in Science and Academia**

Lulu Odell Gaiser, born in June 1896 in Crediton, Ontario, led a remarkable life shaped by a blend of academic brilliance, groundbreaking contributions to botany, and her role as a pioneering educator. Gaiser's legacy as one of the first women to hold prominent academic positions and her historic work in cytotaxonomy have left an indelible mark in the world of science. Her story, however, also deeply intertwines with the influence and support of her parents, who were significant figures in her life.

### Early Life and Family

Gaiser was born as the second daughter of **William H. "Black Bill" Gaiser** and **Salome Schwartz**. William H. Gaiser was born on September 2, 1864, in Stephen Township, Huron County, Ontario, and passed away in 1964 at the age of 99 in Crediton, Stephen Township, Huron County, Ontario. Salome Schwartz, born on June 30, 1862, in Ontario, passed away on January 3, 1936, at the age of 73. Both were integral to Lulu's formative years and contributed to the stability and encouragement she received to pursue her academic ambitions.

The Gaiser family lived on a farm in Stephen Township, just west of Crediton. Their home was situated on Lot 10, Concession 9 of Stephen Township, in Huron County, Ontario, in a rural setting that deeply influenced Gaiser's life and work. The Gaiser family farm became a foundation where Lulu spent her early years, nurturing a connection with nature and the land that would later play a significant role in her botanical studies.

### Education and Early Career

After completing her early education in Crediton, Gaiser attended Western University in London, Ontario, where she became one of only ten women to graduate in the Class of 1916. She continued to forge her academic path by earning a teaching degree from the College of Education in Toronto in 1917 and went on to serve as the principal of the continuation school in Crediton, which offered high school courses in smaller communities.

In 1919, Gaiser moved to New York City to teach at an experimental school for immigrant children. It was during this time that she earned her master's degree from Columbia University in 1921 and later a PhD in plant pathology and cytology in 1927. Her research at Columbia University, especially her dissertation on "Chromosome numbers and species characters in Anthurium," earned her recognition and set the stage for her groundbreaking work in the emerging field of cytotaxonomy.

### McMaster University: Breaking Barriers

Gaiser's academic career reached new heights in 1925, when she became the first woman to join the faculty at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Her appointment as a lecturer and assistant to Roger Wilson Smith marked a historic moment in the university's history. At a time when academic positions were largely dominated by men, Gaiser's appointment was met with mixed reactions. Despite challenges, she quickly made a significant impact both in the classroom and in her advocacy for gender equality on campus.

Gaiser was a fierce advocate for women’s rights within academia. She led campaigns to allow women to study in the university's library on Saturday afternoons—a privilege previously denied to them—and pushed for the appointment of a Dean of Women at McMaster, a position that was finally created in 1930. Her advocacy for women’s inclusion in higher education led her to become known as a "rabid, vociferous feminist" and earned her the title of “the first invasion of McMaster’s faculty by a woman."

Her tenure at McMaster was defined not only by her academic achievements but also by her vibrant and energetic approach to teaching. Her lectures were described as dramatic and colorful, and she became known for her passionate commitment to the field of botany. Gaiser was instrumental in the establishment of McMaster’s first greenhouse, a facility that played a crucial role in her efforts to create a program in natural history and prepare women graduates for teaching in local schools.

### Later Career and Return to Crediton

After 24 years of pioneering work at McMaster, Gaiser joined the Gray Herbarium at Harvard University as a research fellow in 1949. Her plant specimens can still be found in the herbarium, alongside many others in botanical collections across North America. However, in 1954, Gaiser returned to Crediton to care for her aging father. Despite no longer having a research lab or greenhouse, she continued her fieldwork in Huron and Lambton counties, collaborating with Indigenous women on botanical studies, a rare and progressive partnership for the time.

### Personal Life and Legacy

Throughout her later years, Gaiser faced personal loss with the death of her sister Lillian in 1960 and her father's passing in 1964, just before his 100th birthday. Yet, she remained dedicated to her work, continuing to document the local flora in her community. After an extended vacation to California, Gaiser passed away in her sleep on April 7, 1965, at the age of 68. She was buried beside her parents at Crediton Evangelical Brethren Cemetery, just down the road from the family farm where she had grown up.

Her legacy has been preserved through her groundbreaking research, her role as an advocate for women in academia, and her dedication to botany. Gaiser's floristic survey of Lambton County was published posthumously in 1966, solidifying her impact on the scientific community.

### Honoring a Trailblazer

As McMaster University celebrates the 100th anniversary of Lulu Gaiser's appointment to the faculty, discussions are underway to honor her life and legacy. Her story is one of perseverance, determination, and groundbreaking achievements in the face of societal barriers. Gaiser’s pioneering role in academia and her contributions to the field of botany continue to inspire future generations of scientists, women in academia, and educators.
