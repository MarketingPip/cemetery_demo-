*In the Days of the Canada Company* (1896) offers a vivid narrative of settlement and development in Western Ontario during the early 19th century. The book recounts the experiences of pioneers, the role of the Canada Company in colonization, and the transformation of untamed wilderness into thriving communities. Rich in local color and historical insight, it remains a valuable resource on Ontarioâ€™s frontier era.
