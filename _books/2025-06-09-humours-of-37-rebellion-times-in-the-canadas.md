Humours of '37 offers a vivid, often anecdotal look into the Rebellions of 1837 in Upper and Lower Canada. Blending humor, tragedy, and historical reflection, this 1897 work presents personal stories and folklore surrounding the turbulent era. It remains a unique lens through which to view the political unrest and human dimensions of Canada’s early struggles for reform.
