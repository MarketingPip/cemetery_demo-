*Vanished Villages of Middlesex* by Jennifer Grainger explores the lost and forgotten villages of the Middlesex area, likely located in Ontario. This historical work sheds light on the changing landscape and communities that once thrived but have since disappeared, either due to economic, geographical, or societal shifts. The book is a valuable resource for historians, local researchers, and anyone interested in the dynamic history of rural Ontario.
